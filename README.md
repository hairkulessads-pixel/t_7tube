 # 7tube
-Ads Matching Algorithm, TikTok-style UI flow, and System Architecture into your 7tube application
+
+A repository foundation for **7tube**, a short-video platform that now includes a richer web control-center prototype, a multi-route Node API, shared ranking/ads logic, and implementation docs for future product phases.
+
+## Repository layout

+```
+
+## Quick start
+
+### 1. Validate the workspace
+
+```bash
+npm run check
+```
+
+### 2. Build generated artifacts
+
+```bash
+npm run build
+```
+
+### 3. Start the API
+
+```bash
+npm run dev:api
+```
+
+### 4. Open the web prototype
+
+Open `apps/web/src/index.html` in your browser.
+
+- When the API is running on `http://127.0.0.1:7070`, the UI loads live JSON from `/api/platform/overview` and `/api/feed`.
+- When the API is unavailable, the UI falls back to repository seed data so the prototype still renders.
+
+## Included capabilities
+
+- **API-backed frontend prototype** with operational metrics, roadmap cards, creator highlights, infrastructure notes, and feed/ad recommendation cards.
+- **Expanded API surface** with routes for health, filtered feed retrieval, ad previews, and platform overview metadata.
+- **Shared business logic** for creator-aware feed assembly and explainable ad ranking.
+- **Centralized product config** for feature flags, environments, SLOs, and roadmap stages.
+- **Build outputs** that package both the web source and docs into `dist/` along with a generated manifest.
+
+## API routes
+
+| Route | Purpose |
+| --- | --- |
+| `/health` | Health and dependency status |
+| `/api/feed?limit=3&category=fitness` | Feed payload with creator + recommended ad enrichment |
+| `/api/ads/preview?videoId=vid_fit_001` | Best ad recommendation for one or more videos |
+| `/api/platform/overview` | Dashboard metrics, creator profiles, roadmap, SLOs |
+
+## Next implementation milestones
+
+1. Replace the static browser-open workflow with a bundled React or Next.js app.
+2. Add persistence for creators, videos, ad campaigns, and moderation queues.
+3. Introduce event ingestion, experimentation config, and recommendation pipelines.
+4. Add Android/iOS apps that consume the shared contracts and platform config.
